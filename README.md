# The Sweet Shop
This project is a simple recipe webpage created using HTML and CSS, where Iâ€™ve written and showcased some delicious sweet recipes like cake and rasmalai. The website is designed with a clean and attractive layout, making it easy to read and follow the recipes. It also serves as a beginner-friendly project to practice basic web development skills while combining creativity with coding.
